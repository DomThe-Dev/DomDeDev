Hello there, and welcome to my GitHub profile! You may be wondering who I am, and I go by many names.

There are some who call me.. Dom.. 

Whatever you decide to call me, know that I have many talents, including **Programming**, **Game Development**, **Video Editing**, **Tech Repair** and **Narrative Design**. However, my talents range from **Network Engineering**, to **3D Artist**, to  even **Hospitality and Catering**.

A large part of my Narrative Design skills are from DMing in Dungeons and Dragons, which if you want to see, you'll have to contact me. Any videos I edit will also be linked somewhere here at a later date.

I am a firm believer in the classic quote:
> Jack of all trades, but a master of none is still better than a master of one.

I tend to display my many talents on my [Portfolio](https://domthe-dev.github.io/devportfolio/), where you will also be able to view my resume!
